The AVRcam system is distributed in the hope that it will be useful. However, no warranties,
either expressed or implied, are made regarding the operation, use or results of this system. The
AVRcam should not be used in any life-critical applications.

The AVRcam is an embedded machine vision system based on an Omnivision OV6620 CMOS image sensor and ATmega microcontroller that can perform simple color
blob tracking. It is designed to be a subsystem to a more complex embedded project and uses a standard TTL serial interface. The AVRcam also comes with
standalone, cross-platform client software to interface with a computer.
