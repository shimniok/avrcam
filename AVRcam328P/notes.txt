Thing to check to get the ATmega328P working

1. Makefile specifies color map at particular 256-byte boundary; recompile with Makefile?
	Makefile had --section-start=.noinit=0x800300 but reported overlap:

section .noinit [00800300 -> 0080032f] overlaps section .bss [00800110 -> 00800383]

	So I set it to 800400 and it compiled but cam won't stop blinking (crashing?)

Can instead set in configuration within AVRStudio, so set to 0x800400:

-Wl,-section-start=.noinit=0x800400

Now MCU doesn't crash. *shrug*

CameraInterface.c has:
unsigned char colorMap[NUM_ELEMENTS_IN_COLOR_MAP] __attribute__ ((section (".noinit")));

2. Ensure timer initializations are correct
	Timer0 -- appears ok and working
	Timer1 -- not sure yet

3. Ensure interrupts are correct

	Need to verify interrupts are being enabled

4. Ensure interrupt handlers are working
	Timer0 overflow -- why is the overflow handler commented out in CamInterfaceAsm.S ? Don't know; is same in orig.

	Have fixed all the handlers, should be working according to list output

	MCU appears to be crashing? LED turns off after a few seconds and no more response on UART
